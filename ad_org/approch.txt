Approch:-

1.) Importing data 
2.) No missing values found but there are some faulty value in  some variables.
3.) Combine all data and then Convert 'F' values with nan .
4.) Carried out values from duration and published column also created 2 new variables as total seconds & watch(user has just view that add or vid)
5.) Imputed nan values with Randomforest as that's fit better than mean, median , K-nearest neighbour and LR imputation.
6.) Done some more analysis over data and found that most of data is right sckewed.(target variable too)
7.) Check for outliers and imputed them with mean.
8.) Check for correlation but not such hight correlation found in data.
9.) Scaling of Independent variables (mean = 0 and unit variance)
10.) Use SelectKbest for selecting top features // Also tried PCA on dummy variables for best feature selection
11.) Created validation set & Applied three models (Linear regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
12.) Crossvalidate all models and Randomforest fits best among others.
13.) Also iuse a different approch by prediction from different models and then try their mean as the final prediction but result were same as random forest.
14.) Final Model = Random Forest & generate prediction on it.
